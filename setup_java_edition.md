# Setup Java Edition Server

::: tip
This section assumes that you already have JRE installed. If not, see [Dependencies](/setup_package.md).

## Download Server Core

The server core is the essential part of a Minecraft server. In general, all other required files will be generated by the core once started.

We will use Paper core as an example. Here are some popular versions

- [1.18.2](https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.18.2/builds/388/downloads/paper-1.18.2-388.jar)
- [1.19.4](https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.19.4/builds/524/downloads/paper-1.19.4-524.jar)
- [1.20.4](https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.20.4/builds/389/downloads/paper-1.20.4-389.jar)

## Starting Minecraft Server

After creating the instance, navigate to the instance console and start it by clicking the `Start` button located in the top-right corner.

## EULA

::: warning
If you do not agree to the Mojang's End-User License Agreement (EULA), you will not be able to start your server.
:::

To start the server for the first time, you must accept the `End-User License Agreement (EULA)`. To accept EULA, go to `Configuration Files`, and you will see `eula.txt`, click `edit` and select `yes`.

If you can't find this file, try starting your server.
